Issue 4468: Interpretation of time field in UtcT? (orb_revision)
Source: Triodia Technologies Pty Ltd (Mr. Michi Henning, michi(at)triodia.com)
Nature: Uncategorized Issue
Severity: 
Summary: in the absence of an RTF for the time service, I'm sending this to the
core RTF. (You could argue that this is a core issue anyway, since
the core depends on the time service for messaging.)

What is the interpretation of the time and tdf fields in a UtcT?

The spec shows:

	struct UtcT {
		TimeT		time;		// 8 octets
		unsigned long	inacclo;	// 4 octets
		unsigned short	inacchi;	// 2 octets
		TdfT		tdf;		// 2 octets
						// total 16 octets.
	};

For TimeT, the spec says:

	TimeT represents a single time value, which is 64 bits in size, and
	holds the number of 100 nanoseconds that have passed since the base
	time. For absolute time the base is 15 October 1582 00:00.

For UtcT, the spec says:

	UtcT defines the structure of the time value that is used
	universally in this service. The basic value of time is of type
	TimeT that is held in the time field. Whether a UtcT structure
	is holding a relative or absolute time is determined by its history.
	[...]
	The tdf field holds time zone information. Implementation must
	place the time displacement factor for the local time zone in this
	field whenever they create a UTO.

Resolution: see below
Revised Text: Replace the text in section 1.3.2.4 of formal/00-06-26 and section 2.2.1.4 of ptc/00-04-02, 
"Type UtcT" in its entirety with the following text: 

    UtcT defines the structure of the time value that is used 
    universally in this service. The basic value of time is of type 
    TimeT that is held in the time field. Whether a UtcT structure 
    is holding a relative time (that is, a duration) or an absolute 
    time 
    is determined by context; there is no explicit flag within the 
    object holding that state information. (Note that, if a UtcT 
    structure is used to hold a duration, its tdf must be set to 
    zero.) 
    The iacclo and inacchi fields together hold a 48-bit estimate of 
    inaccuracy in the time field. These two fields together hold a 
    value of type InaccuracyT packed into 48 bits. The tdf field 
    holds time zone information. Implementations must place the 
    time displacement factor for the local time zone in this field 
    whenever they create a UTO that expresses absolute time. 

    The time field of a UtcT used to express absolute time holds 
    UTC time, irrespective of the local time zone. For example, 
    to express the time 3:00pm in Germany (which is one hour east 
    of the Universal Time Zone), the time field must be set to 2:00pm 
    on the given date, and the tdf field must be set to 60. This means 
    that, for any given UtcT value 'utc', the local time can be 
    computed as 

             utc.time + utc.tdf * 600,000,000 

             Note that it is possible to produce correct UtcT values 
             by always setting the tdf field to zero and only setting the time 
             field to UTC time; however, implementations are encouraged to 
             include the local time zone information for the UtcT values they 
             produce.

Hi,

in the absence of an RTF for the time service, I'm sending this to the
core RTF. (You could argue that this is a core issue anyway, since
the core depends on the time service for messaging.)

What is the interpretation of the time and tdf fields in a UtcT?

The spec shows:

    struct UtcT {
	   TimeT		time;		// 8 octets
				unsigned long	inacclo;	// 4
	   octets
		unsigned short	inacchi;	// 2 octets
			 TdfT			tdf;	// 2 octets
								//
	   total 16 octets.
	   };

For TimeT, the spec says:

    TimeT represents a single time value, which is 64 bits in size,
    and
    holds the number of 100 nanoseconds that have passed since the
    base
    time. For absolute time the base is 15 October 1582 00:00.

For UtcT, the spec says:

    UtcT defines the structure of the time value that is used
    universally in this service. The basic value of time is of type
    TimeT that is held in the time field. Whether a UtcT structure
    is holding a relative or absolute time is determined by its
    history.
    [...]
    The tdf field holds time zone information. Implementation must
    place the time displacement factor for the local time zone in this
    field whenever they create a UTO.

So, how do I encode absolute time. Let's assume I'm in Greenwich, and
I
want to encoded 2:00pm. Fine, I put the magic number for 2:00pm on
some
date into the time field, and I set the tdf field to zero because I'm
on the zero meridian.

Now, how do I encode 3:00pm German time? (Germany is one hour east of
Greenwich, so when it is 2:00pm in Greenwich, it's 3:00pm in
Frankfurt.)

There are two interpretations for encoding 3:00pm in Frankfurt:

      1) Put UTC time (that is, 2:00pm) into the time field and
         set the tdf field to 60.

	    With that interpretation, the time field always contains
	    UTC time
	       and the tdf field merely serves as an annotation of
	    where the
	       time was produced. To get to local time, I add the time
	    and the
	       tdf offset.

	       2) Put German time (that is, 3:00pm) into the time
                  field and
		     set the tdf field to 60.

		        With that interpretation, the time field
		        always contains local
			   time and the tdf field indicates the offset
		        from UTC as for
			   interpretation one. To get to UTC time, I
		        subtract the tdf
			   offset from the time field.

Which interpretation is correct? (Both are meaningful.)

Given the words in the spec about TimeT ("For absolute time the base
is
15 October 1582 00:00"), together with the fact that the description
of
UtcT doesn't say anything to the contrary, I have to assume that
interpretation (1) is correct. This should be clarified in the spec
though.
(And example would do wonders!)

Further, if I'm in Germany and want to *produce* a (local time) value
of
3:00pm, how do I have to encode it? Am I obliged to always set the tdf
field to the local timezone offset? Or can I simply produce all times
in UTC (for the time field) and always set the tdf field to zero?

I believe that always setting the time field to UTC time and always
setting
the tdf field to zero is legal but, again, the spec doesn't say, so
this
should be clarified.

Can people please look at their implementations of UtcT and speak up
as
to how they work? For what it's worth, ORBacus uses interpretation
(1),
and Orbix 2000 avoids the issue by always writing UTC time and always
setting
the tdf field to zero.

Finally, the spec says that a UtcT can be either absolute or relative
time.
The spec never defines what "relative" time is but, from reading
things
in context, it appears that what is meant is a duration, such as
"1 second" from now. This begs the question then why a UtcT is to be
used
for durations because the tdf field inside a UtcT has meaning only for
absolute time. A duration would be better indicated by a raw TimeT
(but
a raw TimeT doesn't have an accuracy estimate, sigh...)

Looks like the concepts of absolute time, absolute time with an
accuracy
estimate, duration, duration with an accuracy estimate, and local time
have been badly mangled here :-(

Further to this issue, the spec says for UtcT:

	The contents of this structure are intended to be opaque, but
	in order to be able to marshal it correctly, at least the
	types
	of fields need to be identified.

That clearly is nonsense because UtcT values need to be exchanged
between
different implementations. This means that not only the types, but the
semantics of those types must be specified (but currently, they are
not).

The above sentence should be struck from the spec.

I think interpretation 1 is correct, from what I remember from the ISO
standards when I used to hack ASN.1.  The timezone information is
essentially optional, but can be useful to allow programs to
accurately
present the local time value.

Interpretation 1 is also generally more efficient, since it allows
comparison of UTC values without having to do additional math to shift
the values to a common time zone.

I agree. Interpretation 1 is also my personal favourite :-)

Jishnu, can we update the time spec to remove the amiguity?

Fundamentally I agree with you - absolute and relative times should be
different types.

But just to stretch for an interpretation - if you have absolute times
T1 and T2, and a relative time DT = T2-T1, doesn't it make a little
sense for the DT.tdf = T2.tdf - T1.tdf? So, given T1 and DT you can
faithfully reconstruct T2.

Interesting idea! But I don't think that makes sense, because it
doesn't
make sense for T1 and T2 to have non-zero tdf anyway, because tdf
simply
doesn't make sense for a duration...

Sure. Propose a precise wording in a resolution and we will vote it
through the Core RTF.

BTW, since I was the poor sap stucky who had to put together a
passable
original Time Service spec:-(, I can say with some authority that the
intended interpretation was interpretation 1.:-)

Jishnu.

Proposal for 4468:

Replace the text in section 1.3.2.4, "Type UtcT" in its entirety with
the following text:

    UtcT defines the structure of the time value that is used
    universally in this service. The basic value of time is of type
    TimeT that is held in the time field. Whether a UtcT structure
    is holding a relative time (that is, a duration) or an absolute
    time
    is determined by context; there is no explicit flag within the
    object holding that state information. (Note that, if a UtcT
    structure is used to hold a duration, its tdf must be set to
    zero.)
    The iacclo and inacchi fields together hold a 48-bit estimate of
    inaccuracy in the time field. These two fields together hold a
    value of type InaccuracyT packed into 48 bits. The tdf field
    holds time zone information. Implementations must place the
    time displacement factor for the local time zone in this field
    whenever they create a UTO that expresses absolute time.

    The time field of a UtcT used to express absolute time holds
    UTC time, irrespective of the local time zone. For example,
    to express the time 3:00pm in Germany (which is one hour east
    of the Universal Time Zone), the time field must be set to 2:00pm
    on the given date, and the tdf field must be set to 60. This means
    that, for any given UtcT value 'utc', the local time can be
    computed as

	     utc.time + utc.tdf * 600,000,000
	     
	     Note that it is possible to produce correct UtcT values
	     by always
	     setting the tdf field to zero and only setting the time
	     field to

Replace the text in section 1.3.2.4, "Type UtcT" in its entirety with
the following text:

    UtcT defines the structure of the time value that is used

    TimeT that is held in the time field. Whether a UtcT structure
    is holding a relative time (that is, a duration) or an absolute
    time
    is determined by context; there is no explicit flag within the
    object holding that state information. (Note that, if a UtcT
    structure is used to hold a duration, its tdf must be set to
    zero.)
    The iacclo and inacchi fields together hold a 48-bit estimate of
    inaccuracy in the time field. These two fields together hold a
    value of type InaccuracyT packed into 48 bits. The tdf field
    holds time zone information. Implementations must place the
    time displacement factor for the local time zone in this field
    whenever they create a UTO that expresses absolute time.

    The time field of a UtcT used to express absolute time holds
    UTC time, irrespective of the local time zone. For example,
    to express the time 3:00pm in Germany (which is one hour east
    of the Universal Time Zone), the time field must be set to 2:00pm
    on the given date, and the tdf field must be set to 60. This means
    that, for any given UtcT value 'utc', the local time can be
    computed as

	     utc.time + utc.tdf * 600,000,000
	     
	     Note that it is possible to produce correct UtcT values
	     by always
	     setting the tdf field to zero and only setting the time
	     field to
	     UTC time; however, implementations are encouraged to

The following note on RT Profile for UML brings up a relevant, but

Hello,
Understanding that the time frame for kibitzing the UML Profile for 
Schedulability, Performance, and Time is well past, I offer the 
following only as a possible friendly amendment, and FYI.
Referencing ad/2001-06-14, document-page 91, alias PDF-page 105: 
syntax for timestamps:
While it is true that there is information being captured here that is 
not covered by ISO 8601, the syntax that overlaps with ISO 8601 has 
some possibly gratuitous differences with that standard. If the 
change is painless, you may wish to consider harmonizing with that 
standard to the extent possible.
My favorite summary of ISO 8601 is available at 
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html

The relevant text from the Web page is:

Time Zone
Without any further additions, a date and time as written above is
assumed to be in some local time zone. In order to indicate that a
time is measured in Universal Time (UTC), you can append a capital
letter Z to a time as in 
23:59:59Z or 2359Z 
[The Z stands for the "zero meridian", which goes through Greenwich in
London, and it is also commonly used in radio communication where it
is pronounced "Zulu" (the word for Z in the international radio
alphabet). Universal Time (sometimes also called "Zulu Time") was
called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) before 1972, however this term should
no longer be used. Since the introduction of an international atomic
time scale, almost all existing civil time zones are now related to
UTC, which is slightly different from the old and now unused GMT.] 
The strings 
+hh:mm, +hhmm, or +hh
can be added to the time to indicate that the used local time zone is
hh hours and mm minutes ahead of UTC. For time zones west of the zero
meridian, which are behind UTC, the notation 
-hh:mm, -hhmm, or -hh
is used instead. For example, Central European Time (CET) is +0100 and
U.S./Canadian Eastern Standard Time (EST) is -0500. The following
strings all indicate the same point of time: 
12:00Z = 13:00+01:00 = 0700-0500
There exists no international standard that specifies abbreviations
for civil time zones like CET, EST, etc. and sometimes the same
abbreviation is even used for two very different time zones. In
addition, politicians enjoy modifying the rules for civil time zones,
especially for daylight saving times, every few years, so the only
really reliable way of describing a local time zone is to specify
numerically the difference of local time to UTC. Better use directly
UTC as your only time zone where this is possible and then you do not
have to worry about time zones and daylight saving time changes at
all.

Issue 4468: Interpretation of time field in UtcT? (orb_revision)

Click here for this issue's archive.
Source: IONA (Mr. Michi Henning, michi.henning@iona.com)
Nature: Uncategorized Issue
Severity:
Summary: 
in the absence of an RTF for the time service, I'm sending this to the
core RTF. (You could argue that this is a core issue anyway, since
the core depends on the time service for messaging.)

What is the interpretation of the time and tdf fields in a UtcT?

The spec shows:

        struct UtcT {
                TimeT           time;           // 8 octets
                unsigned long   inacclo;        // 4 octets
                unsigned short  inacchi;        // 2 octets
                TdfT            tdf;            // 2 octets
                                                // total 16 octets.
        };

For TimeT, the spec says:

        TimeT represents a single time value, which is 64 bits in
        size,
and
        holds the number of 100 nanoseconds that have passed since the
base
        time. For absolute time the base is 15 October 1582 00:00.

For UtcT, the spec says:

        UtcT defines the structure of the time value that is used
        universally in this service. The basic value of time is of
        type
        TimeT that is held in the time field. Whether a UtcT structure
        is holding a relative or absolute time is determined by its
history.
        [...]
        The tdf field holds time zone information. Implementation must
        place the time displacement factor for the local time zone in
this
        field whenever they create a UTO.

Resolution:
The proposed replacement text below need to be applied to both the
original Time Service
and the Enhnced View of Time Specification ptc/00-04-02
Revised Text:
Replace the text in section 1.3.2.4 of formal/00-06-26 and section
2.2.1.4 of ptc/00-04-02, 
"Type UtcT" in its entirety with the following text:

    universally in this service. The basic value of time is of type

    time
    is determined by context; there is no explicit flag within the
    object holding that state information. (Note that, if a UtcT
    structure is used to hold a duration, its tdf must be set to

             by always

             include
             the local time zone information for the UtcT values they
             produce.
